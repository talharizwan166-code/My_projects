Student performance prediction using KNN 
 
Tools and Technologies: 
• Python 
• Pandas 
• Scikit-learn 
• VS Code 
 
Introductions: 
 Predicting student academic outcomes in advance can help educators take 
timely actions. This project focuses on building a simple machine learning 
system that predicts whether a student will pass or fail using academic 
indicators. 
 
Problem statement: 
Traditional evaluation methods are slow and depend heavily on manual effort. 
There is a need for an automated system that can quickly analyze student data 
and predict academic performance. 
 
Proposed solution: 
The proposed system uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify 
students as Pass or Fail based on attendance, quizzes, assignments, and 
midterm marks. 
 
Methodology: 
Student data will be collected and preprocessed using Python libraries. The 
dataset will be split into training and testing sets. A KNN model will then be 
trained and evaluated based on prediction accuracy. 
• Data collection 
• Preprocessing 
• Train-test split 
• Model training 
• Accuracy evaluation 
• Train/test ratio (80/20) 
• Value of K (k = 3) 
• Evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, classification report) 
Expected outcome: 
The system is expected to predict student results with reasonable accuracy and 
help identify students who may need academic support. 
 
Future Enhancements: 
 Increase dataset size 
 Add GUI 
 Apply data normalization
  Try other ML Algorithms
